Image transformations are techniques used in computer vision and image processing to modify the appearance of an image. Here are some common image transformations:

**1. Translation:**
Translation involves shifting an image along the x and y axes. It can be used to move the entire image to a different location. In 2D image transformations, you can specify the amount of horizontal and vertical displacement to achieve the translation.

**2. Rotation:**
Rotation is the process of rotating an image by a certain angle around a specified point. It can be used to change the orientation of an image. Common rotation angles are 90 degrees (for a 90-degree rotation) or any other angle. You can perform both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations.

**3. Scaling:**
Scaling involves resizing an image by a certain factor along the x and y axes. You can scale an image up to make it larger or down to make it smaller. Scaling by a factor greater than 1 makes the image larger, while scaling by a factor between 0 and 1 makes it smaller.

**4. Shearing :**
Shearing is a transformation that distorts the shape of an image. It involves tilting or slanting an image along one or both axes. Shearing can be applied in both horizontal and vertical directions, and it can be used to create various effects, such as making an object appear to be skewed or stretched.
